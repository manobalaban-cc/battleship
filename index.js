/*
Example to show how the three callable function looks in action.
The `displayBoard` function requires an object as an argument,
and it should have two properties:
`boardNumber` with 1 (left) or 2 (right) to decide where you would like to display,
and `board`, which should be a nested array to display.
`displayMessage` and `displayTextMessage` are functions to display messages:
They require two arguments: first is a string to display,
and the second is a color (can be text, RGB, RGBA, or hex color).
